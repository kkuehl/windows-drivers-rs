//! Allocator implementation to use with `#[global_allocator]` to allow use of
//! [`core::alloc`], plus the fallible allocation APIs that make it usable
//! without a bugcheck path.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust, no_run
//! #[cfg(all(
//!     any(driver_model__driver_type = "WDM", driver_model__driver_type = "KMDF"),
//!     not(test)
//! ))]
//! use wdk_alloc::WdkAllocator;
//!
//! #[cfg(all(
//!     any(driver_model__driver_type = "WDM", driver_model__driver_type = "KMDF"),
//!     not(test)
//! ))]
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static GLOBAL_ALLOCATOR: WdkAllocator = WdkAllocator;
//! ```
//!
//! # Installing the allocator is not enough
//!
//! `WdkAllocator` (not linked here: it only exists for the WDM and KMDF driver
//! types, so the link would not resolve in a library documentation build)
//! reports failure by returning null, as
//! [`core::alloc::GlobalAlloc`] requires. What turns that null into a bugcheck
//! is the *caller*: [`alloc::vec::Vec::push`],
//! [`alloc::vec::Vec::with_capacity`], [`alloc::boxed::Box::new`],
//! [`alloc::sync::Arc::new`] and [`Iterator::collect`] all respond to a null by
//! calling [`alloc::alloc::handle_alloc_error`], which in a driver is
//! `KeBugCheckEx`.
//!
//! Driver code therefore needs the fallible counterparts in [`fallible`],
//! which are available on a stable toolchain and require no crate features:
//!
//! * [`fallible::FallibleVec`] — `try_push` and `try_extend`, in place of
//!   [`alloc::vec::Vec::push`] and [`alloc::vec::Vec::extend`]
//! * [`fallible::TryCollectVec`] — `try_collect_vec` in place of
//!   [`Iterator::collect`]
//! * [`fallible::try_vec_with_capacity`] — in place of
//!   [`alloc::vec::Vec::with_capacity`]
//! * [`fallible::try_box`] — in place of [`alloc::boxed::Box::new`]
//!
//! [`alloc::sync::Arc`] has no counterpart here. There used to be a
//! hand-written strong-count-only `sync::Arc`, because `Arc::try_new` sits
//! behind the unstable `allocator_api` feature and a stable toolchain therefore
//! had no fallible way to build a shared pointer at all. A driver that can
//! enable `#![feature(allocator_api)]` should use `Arc::try_new` and
//! `Arc::try_new_in` from `alloc` instead: they cover `Arc<T>`, `Weak`, and
//! `make_mut`, none of which a hand-written substitute did, and they are not
//! 300 lines of unsafe refcounting for this crate to keep correct. Note that
//! `Arc::try_new_uninit_slice` does not exist, so a fallible `Arc<[T]>` still
//! has to go through an `Arc<Vec<T>>`.
//!
//! Two near-misses that look like they would give a stable fallible `Arc` and
//! do not, recorded so they are not retried:
//!
//! * `Arc::from(try_box(value)?)` still allocates. `From<Box<T>>` has to build
//!   the strong/weak count block and move the value into it, and that second
//!   allocation is infallible.
//! * A one-element [`alloc::vec::Vec`] reserved with
//!   [`alloc::vec::Vec::try_reserve_exact`] and then `into_boxed_slice`d is not
//!   reliable either: `try_reserve_exact` is documented to be allowed to
//!   over-allocate, and when capacity exceeds length `into_boxed_slice` shrinks
//!   — an infallible reallocation.
