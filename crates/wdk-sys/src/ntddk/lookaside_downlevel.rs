//! `ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx` and `ExFreeToLookasideListEx`, which cannot
//! be bound as plain externs without raising every consumer's minimum OS to
//! Windows 11 22H2.
//!
//! # The problem these solve
//!
//! `10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:26324` is `#if (NTDDI_VERSION >= NTDDI_WIN10_NI)`.
//! Above it the two routines are `NTKERNELAPI` declarations
//! (`10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:26331` and `:26338`); below it, in the `#else` at
//! `:26343-26433`, the WDK supplies `FORCEINLINE` bodies instead.
//! `NTDDI_WIN10_NI` is Windows 11 22H2 / Windows Server 2025.
//!
//! Every WDK citation in this file names the header version it was read from,
//! because the line numbers move by roughly a thousand lines between WDKs: the
//! same gate is at `10.0.22621.0/km/wdm.h:25341`. An unqualified `km/wdm.h:NNN`
//! resolves to unrelated code against any other kit, which for this file is a
//! hazard rather than an inconvenience — the justification below is the only
//! thing standing between a reader and "simplifying" these two back into plain
//! externs, which would silently restore the load floor this module exists to
//! remove.
//!
//! MSVC honours the `FORCEINLINE` and emits no import, which is why a C driver
//! built against a current WDK still loads on Windows 10. bindgen cannot inline
//! a `FORCEINLINE`, so it emits ordinary externs — and an extern is an import
//! the kernel's image loader must resolve **before `DriverEntry` is entered**.
//! An image importing these two therefore fails to load on every build of
//! Windows 10 and on Server 2016, 2019 and 2022, with no trace and nothing in
//! any log attributing it.
//!
//! Measured on a downstream minifilter built against this crate: the two were
//! the highest gate in its import table, and the shipping C++ driver it is a
//! port of imports neither. So the asymmetry is an artefact of binding
//! generation rather than a design choice, and nothing in the Rust source of
//! either crate says so.
//!
//! `build.rs` blocklists the two functions from the `ntddk` bindings and
//! `ntddk.rs` re-exports these in their place, so consumers need no change.
//!
//! # How they behave
//!
//! Each resolves its own routine once, through `MmGetSystemRoutineAddress`, and
//! caches the result. That is the pattern Microsoft documents for calling a DDI
//! that may be absent on an older kernel while keeping the image loadable on
//! it.
//!
//! - **Resolved** — the kernel is Windows 11 22H2 or later, which is every
//!   kernel a consumer of this crate could previously load on at all. The
//!   exported routine is called, so behaviour is byte for byte what it was.
//! - **Unresolved** — the kernel is older. This module reproduces the WDK's own
//!   `FORCEINLINE` body at `10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:26343-26433`, including the
//!   `SLIST` cache in `Lookaside->L.ListHead`. That is the shape a C driver
//!   built against a current WDK for a downlevel kernel runs anyway — MSVC
//!   inlines the same body verbatim — and it is what makes a lookaside list
//!   actually cache blocks rather than degenerating into a per-op pool round
//!   trip.
//!
//! # The `SLIST` cache, and why it is now here
//!
//! The `FORCEINLINE` bodies keep an `SLIST` cache in `Lookaside->L.ListHead`.
//! An earlier revision of this file deliberately did not reproduce it,
//! degrading the miss arm to `L.AllocateEx`/`L.FreeEx` on every operation.
//! That was measurable pool pressure on hot paths: a downstream minifilter's
//! forensic worker allocates one lookaside block per monitored FS operation.
//!
//! Two reasons the earlier revision gave for deferring the cache do not
//! survive checking, and are corrected here rather than deleted so that the
//! next reader does not re-derive them:
//!
//! - It is **not** true that restoring the cache requires reading a bitfield
//!   through a union. `#define ExQueryDepthSList(_listhead_)
//!   (_listhead_)->Depth` is the **x86** arm: it sits in the `#else` of
//!   `#if !defined(_X86_)` at `10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:26104`, with the macro at
//!   `:26154`. On x64, with `_NTDDK_`/`_NTIFS_` defined as a kernel driver
//!   build defines them (`:26106`), `ExQueryDepthSList` is an ordinary
//!   `NTKERNELAPI USHORT ExQueryDepthSList(PSLIST_HEADER)` export at
//!   `:26108-26112` — which is why the generated `ntddk` bindings already
//!   contain it, as they do `ExpInterlockedPopEntrySList` and
//!   `ExpInterlockedPushEntrySList` (`:26197` and `:26203`, the two the
//!   `InterlockedPop/PushEntrySList` macros expand to at `:26184-26188`). No
//!   union access is involved.
//! - It is **not** true that the cache would only buy speed on kernels a
//!   consumer cannot load on anyway. Removing the miss-arm `NTDDI_WIN10_NI`
//!   imports is what made the pre-NI window loadable in the first place.
//!   Measured on the downstream minifilter this was written for: no symbol
//!   left in its release import table is declared inside an `NTDDI_VERSION >=
//!   NTDDI_WIN10_NI` gate, and `ExAllocatePool2` — which used to set the
//!   RS2..2004 floor — is now resolved through `MmGetSystemRoutineAddress`
//!   too (see `allocate_pool_downlevel.rs`), so the loadable window now spans
//!   Windows 10 RS2 (1703) through current builds on both client and Server
//!   SKUs. The cache miss arm is therefore live across that entire window on
//!   that driver's hottest allocation path.
//!
//! # Correctness argument for the SLIST cache
//!
//! Both the WDK-exported routines and the WDK's `FORCEINLINE` body operate on
//! the same `Lookaside->L.ListHead` field, and both use the same
//! `InterlockedPop/PushEntrySList` primitives. When the kernel exports the
//! routines, this module delegates to them (the `resolved != ABSENT` arm)
//! rather than duplicating their work — because the exported routine may
//! carry kernel-internal accounting this module cannot see.
//!
//! When the kernel does **not** export them, `ExInitializeLookasideListEx`
//! still zero-initialises the `SLIST_HEADER` and populates the same
//! `AllocateEx`/`FreeEx` callbacks the miss arm uses. So the WDK's own
//! `FORCEINLINE` body — reproduced below — is what a C driver built against
//! the same WDK header runs, byte for byte.
//!
//! What remains true is that the SLIST arm cannot be exercised without a
//! pre-NI machine. The counters `AllocateHits`, `AllocateMisses`, `FreeHits`
//! and `FreeMisses` are maintained so that `!lookaside` in a debugger shows
//! the hit rate that motivates it, giving a positive artefact for any future
//! test.
