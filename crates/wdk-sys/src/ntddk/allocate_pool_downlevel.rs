//! `ExAllocatePool2`, resolved at runtime rather than imported.
//!
//! # The problem this solves
//!
//! `ExAllocatePool2` is `NTKERNELAPI` under
//! `#if (NTDDI_VERSION >= NTDDI_WIN10_VB)` (`10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:9932`,
//! `10.0.22621.0/km/wdm.h:9530`) — Windows 10 2004 / May 2020. Every WDK
//! citation in this file names the header version it was read from, because
//! the line numbers move between WDKs.
//!
//! Every kernel-mode consumer of this crate that names `ExAllocatePool2` as a
//! plain extern turns it into an *import*, which the kernel's image loader
//! must resolve **before `DriverEntry` runs**. On any Windows before build
//! 19041 the loader refuses to bind the image and the driver fails to load
//! with `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` — silently, before anything in the
//! driver runs.
//!
//! The shipping C++ minifilter this fork was written for supports Windows 10
//! 1703 (RS2) and later — its two other RS2-gated imports
//! (`PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx2` and `FsRtlVolumeDeviceToCorrelationId`)
//! set the actual load floor — and it therefore does **not** import
//! `ExAllocatePool2`. Instead it resolves the routine through
//! `MmGetSystemRoutineAddress` at `DriverEntry` (`Common/Allocator.h:80-98`)
//! and falls back to `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` on machines that lack it. That
//! is the pattern Microsoft documents for calling a DDI which may be absent
//! on an older kernel while keeping the image loadable on it.
//!
//! # How it behaves
//!
//! - **Resolved** — the kernel is Windows 10 2004 or later. The exported
//!   routine is called with the caller's flags, size and tag unmodified, so
//!   behaviour is byte for byte what a static import would have produced.
//! - **Unresolved** — the kernel is older. The flags are mapped to a
//!   `_POOL_TYPE` (`POOL_FLAG_PAGED` → `PagedPool`, `POOL_FLAG_NON_PAGED` →
//!   `NonPagedPoolNx`, `POOL_FLAG_NON_PAGED_EXECUTE` → `NonPagedPool`) and
//!   the block is allocated through `ExAllocatePoolWithTag`. The returned
//!   memory is then zeroed with `RtlZeroMemory` unless `POOL_FLAG_UNINITIALIZED`
//!   is set — matching `ExAllocatePool2`'s own zero-by-default contract
//!   (`10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:9906-9925`).
//!
//! `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` itself is `_IRQL_requires_max_(DISPATCH_LEVEL)`
//! for non-paged pool and `PASSIVE_LEVEL` for paged pool — exactly the IRQL
//! constraints `ExAllocatePool2` documents, so the fallback introduces no
//! IRQL regression.
//!
//! # `bindgen` blocklisting and the fallback extern
//!
//! `wdk-build`'s bindgen builder already blocklists `ExAllocatePoolWithTag`
//! as deprecated (`crates/wdk-build/src/bindgen.rs:103`), so no generated
//! binding names it and driver code cannot reach it directly. This module
//! declares it as a private extern here, alongside `RtlZeroMemory`, so the
//! fallback is available *only* through the shim. `wdk-sys/build.rs`
//! blocklists the generated `ExAllocatePool2` and `ntddk.rs` re-exports this
//! implementation under the same name — every existing call site continues
//! to compile unchanged.
//!
//! # IRQL: the resolution is gated at PASSIVE_LEVEL, the allocation is not
//!
//! `MmGetSystemRoutineAddress` is `_IRQL_requires_max_(PASSIVE_LEVEL)`
//! (`10.0.26100.0/km/wdm.h:13974`). `ExAllocatePool2` is
//! `_IRQL_requires_max_(DISPATCH_LEVEL)`, so a caller may legitimately be
//! above `PASSIVE_LEVEL`. Probing there would be the IRQL violation; taking
//! the fallback for that one call is legitimate, and a later call at
//! `PASSIVE_LEVEL` populates the cache for good. This is the same pattern
//! `lookaside_downlevel.rs` uses for `ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx` /
//! `ExFreeToLookasideListEx`.
//!
//! # What could go wrong, and does not
//!
//! - **Zeroing cost when unresolved**: the fallback zeroes with
//!   `RtlZeroMemory` unless the caller passes `POOL_FLAG_UNINITIALIZED`. On
//!   the resolved path the kernel zeroes for us, so the fallback merely
//!   restores parity with the resolved path — not an extra cost that was
//!   avoidable.
//! - **`POOL_FLAG_NON_PAGED_EXECUTE`**: mapped to the deprecated
//!   `NonPagedPool` (executable) rather than `NonPagedPoolNx`. That is
//!   deliberate: the caller asked for executable memory, and silently
//!   downgrading to NX would break code that depends on the executable bit.
//!   `wdk-alloc`'s `POOL_FLAGS_USED` compile-time assertion prevents this
//!   crate's global allocator from taking that path.
