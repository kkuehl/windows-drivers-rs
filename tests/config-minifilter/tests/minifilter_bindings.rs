//! Tests that the `minifilter` API subset of `wdk-sys` generates the bindings
//! that a File System Minifilter driver needs to register itself with the
//! Filter Manager.
//!
//! The Filter Manager routines cannot be called outside of kernel-mode, so
//! these tests instead exercise the *contract* the generated bindings must
//! uphold. Struct layouts are already validated against `fltKernel.h` by the
//! layout assertions bindgen emits into `types.rs`, so they are deliberately
//! not re-asserted with hardcoded offsets here. What these tests pin down is
//! the set of properties bindgen configuration can silently break: that the
//! Filter Manager items are generated at all, that they are reachable at the
//! paths a consumer imports them from, and that the types line up such that a
//! registration can be built without any casts.
