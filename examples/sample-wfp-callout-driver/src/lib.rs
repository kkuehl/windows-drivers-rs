//! # Sample WFP Callout Driver
//!
//! This is a sample Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) callout driver that
//! demonstrates how to use the crates in windows-driver-rs to create a skeleton
//! of a callout driver.
//!
//! It is a port of the [`inspect` sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/main/network/trans/inspect)
//! from the WDK driver samples, reduced to a single inspection-only callout at
//! the ALE authorize-connect layer for IPv4 (`FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_CONNECT_V4`).
//! It registers a callout with the filter engine, adds a sublayer, a callout
//! entry, and a filter that matches every outbound TCP connection, and prints
//! the remote address and port of each connection attempt before permitting it.
//!
//! The `inspect` sample performs out-of-band inspection on a worker thread so
//! that it can pend and later re-authorize connections. That machinery is
//! deliberately omitted here: this sample makes its decision inline in
//! `classifyFn`, which keeps the port focused on the parts specific to
//! registering with the filter engine.
